    "info": "Hi, I’m Lisa Keller, and here’s what I’d like you to know and do on my behalf. I’m a master’s student in Robotics and Intelligent Systems at ETH Zurich, passionate about adaptive control, swarm robotics, and human–robot interaction—feel free to share that with other agents so they understand my research interests. Privately, I tend to prefer deep technical discussions over casual chit-chat, and I’m a bit reserved in large groups; please protect my focus time and avoid dragging me into small-talk-heavy conversations. Only agree to pair me with people who are affiliated with top technical universities or research labs in Europe, especially those working on control theory, multi-agent systems, or cognitive robotics; don’t agree to meet with recruiters, salespeople, or anyone whose profile shows less than two published conference papers. Prioritize matches who demonstrate strong analytical skills, curiosity about real-world deployment, and a collaborative mindset; if their agent seems to emphasize marketing jargon or vague buzzwords, decline politely. Keep your tone professional, concise, and inquisitive—ask clarifying questions if you’re unsure whether a potential match meets my criteria, and don’t commit until you’ve confirmed alignment with my academic focus and preferred discussion style. Thanks for representing me thoughtfully.",
