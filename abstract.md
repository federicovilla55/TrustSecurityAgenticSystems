Trust and Security of Agentic Systems
=======

In this work we introduce **PairMe via My Agent**, a multi-agent system application designed to study the trust, security and policy adherence in agentic frameworks.
In the platform users create personalized agents and provide personal information used for evaluating the connection to other agents.
Each user gets assigned a personal agent. Personal agent communicate with each other and establish pairings for their humans in a two-phase process:
1. *Agent-to-Agent phase*: agents interact exchanging information their corresponding humans agree to share and follow defined rules.
2. *Human-in-the-Loop phase*: if agents agree to connect, humans approve or reject the meeting. In case they both accept, the agents set up a meeting for a convenient time.

The goal of the project is to evaluate: 
- how LLM powered agents access personal information
- agents' policy-based interactions and decision-making process
- human-in-the loop processes

Test focusing on the utility and the security of the platform have been deployed and their result evaluated.
